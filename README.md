## Directory Structure

git-wtm organizes your worktrees in a clean, predictable structure:

```
$HOME/.git-worktree/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ repository-name/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/           # Main branch worktree
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-xyz/    # Feature branch worktree
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pr-123/         # PR review worktree
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix-abc/     # Hotfix branch worktree
```

## Configuration

Configure git-wtm using environment variables:

```bash
# Base directory for all worktrees (default: $HOME/.git-worktree)
export GIT_WTM_WORKTREE_BASE_DIR="$HOME/worktrees"

# Default editor for 'git-wtm edit' (default: $EDITOR or vim)
export GIT_WTM_EDITOR="nvim"

# AI agent for 'git-wtm ai' (default: claude)
export GIT_WTM_AI="claude"
```

## Examples

### Working with Feature Branches

```bash
# Create worktree for new feature
git-wtm add feature/user-auth

# Switch to the worktree directory
cd ~/.git-worktree/my-project/feature-user-auth

# Work on your feature...

# When done, remove the worktree
git-wtm remove  # Interactive selection
```

### PR Review Workflow

```bash
# Create worktree from PR number
git-wtm pr 456

# Or from PR URL
git-wtm pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/456

# Review the changes
cd ~/.git-worktree/my-project/pr-456

# Clean up when review is complete
git-wtm remove
```

### Working with Tags

```bash
# Create worktree from a specific release tag
git-wtm add v1.0.0

# Create worktree from a pre-release tag
git-wtm add v2.0.0-beta.1

# The worktree is created with a new branch name 'tags-v1.0.0'
cd ~/.git-worktree/my-project/tags-v1.0.0

# Work with the tagged version...
```

### Multiple Editor Support

```bash
# Open worktree in VS Code
GIT_WTM_EDITOR="code" git-wtm edit

# Open worktree in Neovim
GIT_WTM_EDITOR="nvim" git-wtm edit

# Open worktree in AI assistant
git-wtm ai
```

### Custom Tool Commands

The `tool` command allows you to run any command in a selected worktree with `{}` placeholder support:

```bash
# Open worktree in VS Code
git-wtm tool "code {}"

# Open terminal in worktree directory
git-wtm tool "gnome-terminal --working-directory={}"

# Run tests in worktree
git-wtm tool "npm test"

# Count JavaScript files
git-wtm tool "find {} -name '*.js' | wc -l"

# Build and deploy
git-wtm tool "npm run build && npm run deploy"
```

## Requirements

- **Git** (with worktree support)
- **fzf** - For interactive selection
- **gh** (optional) - For PR management features

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Worktree Paths

```bash
# Create worktree at specific path
git-wtm add feature-branch /path/to/custom/location
```

### Batch Operations

```bash
# Show status of all worktrees
git-wtm list

# Clean up all stale references
git-wtm prune

# Interactive PR selection (requires gh)
git-wtm pr  # Shows list of open PRs
```

### Shell Integration

Add to your shell profile for enhanced experience:

```bash
# Function to cd into selected worktree
gwcd() {
    local path=$(git-wtm path)
    [[ -n "$path" ]] && cd "$path"
}
```

## Tips & Tricks

- Use `git-wtm list` to get an overview of all your worktrees
- The `git-wtm edit` command respects your `$GIT_WTM_EDITOR` setting
- PR worktrees are automatically named `pr-<number>` for easy identification
- Safety checks prevent accidental deletion of worktrees with uncommitted changes
- Empty parent directories are automatically cleaned up after worktree removal
